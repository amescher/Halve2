## Effective Altruism’s Empowering Weekend

The EA Global 2016 Conference came to a close on Sunday after three days of meeting with great people and discussing existential risk, the power of technology in ending animal suffering, free cities, public policy, the history of aid, personal finance and how EAs can build community.

The conference opened with Will MacAskill (who wrote [Doing Good Better](http://www.effectivealtruism.com/)) discussing how international aid as a concept only came about 50–60 years ago, the data collection required for effective aid only began 20 years ago and the idea of using that data and applying the scientific method to helping the world could have only appeared in a usable form very recently. This is an empowering idea and really set the tone for the weekend — letting the whole crowd feel that there was an inflection point that we were at and that we all have the power to accelerate this movement.

I would describe the whole conference and the talks I had with most of the people there in one word as **empowering**. The conference, even if it may have been a bit theoretical at times, stuck to the core ideology that this world is ripe for change and that we are in a position to change it if we work hard and use the [tools of rationality](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_materials).

I’m hooked. I think effective altruism and its focus on mixing pragmatism, philosophy and “doing good better” has already and will continue to make major changes in the world. The EA movement also can bring positive purpose and direction to those searching for it.

If you’d like to start or join the EA movement please reach out to me and consider the [Try Giving Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/try-giving/). The world needs us and we have power.
