## Ideas & Sharing

Humans differ from animals primarily by being able to communicate and build on complex ideas and having the physical capability to make organized changes in their environment.

Our intellectual, communicative and physical capabilities are the hallmark of the “human experience” and should be used to their fullest extent. But in order to do this certain necessities we share with our animal cousins must be met first. We need to eat, stay in a clean and tolerable environment, and activate our muscles.

I will write on health and wellness another time but today I want to dive into how to make the most out of our communicative and physical capabilities in general and given the technology we have today.

In isolation humans are not good at having complex, accurate ideas beyond those that help with their specific individual situations. An illiterate person of high school age in the middle ages or many countries around the world today in general may be very good at hunting or fishing or building houses — they probably would be very good at certain physical tasks like tree climbing or walking far distances — but they would not be very good at conceptualizing the aggregate effects of supply and demand. Adam Smith was brilliant because his individual situation did not require him to build houses or hunt or fish and did give him the company of people running businesses, interacting with foreign nations, and reading and discussing the thoughts of long-dead orators.

It is possible that some humans naturally are good at developing complex, accurate ideas about the world even in isolation. A shepard looking at the stars long ago may have discovered calculus and had a deep understanding of the way the stars moved. Whatever he may have thought has been rendered irrelevant because his words were never recorded, spoken or acted upon. When Newton discovered the pattern of movement in space and unique ways numbers play together he shared them openly with his friend Edmund Haley — and centuries later we were taking close up photographs of Pluto (a planetoid Newton didn’t know existed).

In the bible Jesus compares humans to lights shining and says “Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way let your light shine before others.” [Matthew 5: 15–16]. The light under the bowl is useless. Learning the secrets of the universe and then spending life in isolation in a monastery hidden in the hills is useless (in the context of furthering good for all).

The point of the last three paragraphs is to highlight the importance of collaborating with others — dead and living — to maximize our potential. We must learn with others and share with others.

In the renaissance and revolutionary era in the west the printing press and coffee houses were the places of collaboration. Pamphlets and good company were where ideas were disseminated and refined. This revolution in sharing ideas was massively important in the insane amount of technological and social progress we’ve made over the past few centuries.

Today we have the internet — a brand new, fast and powerful medium for breaking down space and time barriers for sharing and building on ideas. We also still have coffeeshops and places to meet.

Here’s how I plan on making the fullest use of my ability to “communicate and build on complex ideas”:

1. Write and Read.

1. Putting ideas to paper (or screen) is a process of refinement and permanence. When I have ideas in my head I can dance around them and play with them — but they remain elusive. When outside of my mind I can truly argue with myself. Writing is pretty difficult for me currently — I find speaking and thinking to be easier. Writing is also valuable for sharing information with others. Through it others can spend time with my thoughts as they choose. Certain sentences may be easy for others to understand and others may be very difficult — others can vary their time spent reading each sentence — rephrase it in their heads — and send it back to me to facilitate a better version.

1. Reading allows me to be the other in that transaction. To see and put myself in the frame of mind of the person writing. It allows me to analyze and critique others ideas in a meaningful way. I can ask for clarification…

1. Share.
