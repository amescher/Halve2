## Thoughts on Olympians (2016)
I'm just getting ready to leave Tokyo and while here I've noticed a lot of it's preparation for the 2020 Olympics. Surprisingly, I found an article I wrote at the time of the 2016 Olympics... So here's that post in full.

(Originally Written in 2016)

While watching the Olympics last night I noticed a few things:
1. Everything the competitors do takes immense practice and talent
2. 95% of the competitors (at least on American TV) get completely ignored
3. The newscasters and watching public is everpresent and evercritical and presents a narrative for the olympians to fit into - rather than allowing their own story to be told.

After Aly Raisman's awesome Silver performance and gold winner Simone Biles' incredible Gold performance they were corralled around to get a better picture of the two hugging and congratulating each other. As Aly and Simone were performing with all they had in the background other competitors were doing a separate event. They had trained for decades or years to be a backdrop, an extra, in the narrative of these two for 300,000,000 Americans to watch.

Still out of breath Ryan Lochte was confronted with a camera in his face and a reporter asking if he was disappointed - after coming in _5th in the world_ in the medley event! I wonder how he keeps from snapping out and saying "If all the world's reporters were ranked today, would you make the top 5?" to the interviewer.

I don't know the names of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed finishers off the top of my head because absolutely no focus was placed on them. In this environment even the second best in the world doesn't attract attention.

And when Simone Manuel pours her heart and soul into becoming one of the world's best freestyle swimmers and succeeds she is asked not about her personal accomplishments but what it means for every other black American. She is drawn out of her identity as an incredibly good 16 year old swimmer and asked to be an icon for an entire community.

> "Just coming into this race tonight, I kind of tried to take the weight of the black community off my shoulders, which is something I carry with me just being in this position," Manuel said. "But I do hope that it kind of goes away. . . . The title 'black swimmer' makes it seem like I'm not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I'm not supposed to break records. And that's not true."

She may want to use her position to inspire and encourage but, even if she didn't, that's the narrative forced upon her. While Michael Phelps or Kayla Harrison became the best in the world they get to talk about their personal achievements and hard work - when Simone becomes the best in the world she gets her racial makeup magnified as a part of her identity. She's not a great swimmer - she's a great black swimmer. And that is sad when Kayla Harrison can just be a great judoka.

I'm reminded of The Man in the Arena speech and immensely proud of every athlete at the olympics who dedicated their lives to greatness and put it all on the line. Because it's really their story and we're just pretending to hear it. It's their heroes journey and we're just the spectators in the stands.
